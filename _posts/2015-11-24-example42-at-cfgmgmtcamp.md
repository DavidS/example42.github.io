The [Config Management Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu) has quickly become a conference of reference for who works around it automation and systems management.

The next edition is the 1st and 2nd of February 2016, in Gent, Belgium, right after, and near, the Fosdem days. [Registration]
(http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/#registration) is open, but the tickets are quickly going away.

We are [proud sponsors](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/#sponsor) of the event and we look forward to meet again old and new friends.

See you there.
